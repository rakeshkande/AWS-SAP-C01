= How To Pass AWS Certified Solution Architect Professional Exam (SAP-C01) =

== Online Courses ==
* [ACloudGuru](https://acloudguru.com/course/aws-certified-solutions-architect-professional) ($35/month w. trial)
* [Adrian Cantrill](https://learn.cantrill.io/p/aws-certified-solutions-architect-professional) ($80)
* [AWS Readiness (4h)](https://www.aws.training/Details/eLearning?id=34737) ($0)
* [Neal Davis](https://www.udemy.com/course/aws-certified-solutions-architect-professional-training/) ($10-80, ~$15)
* [Stephane Maarek](https://www.udemy.com/course/aws-solutions-architect-professional/) ($10-125, ~$15)
* [Whizlabs](https://www.whizlabs.com/aws-solutions-architect-professional/) ($19.95, whole site sub $99/year)
* [Zeal Vora](https://www.udemy.com/course/aws-certified-solutions-architect-professional/) ($34.99)

I only have experience with last 3 courses. For me Maarek and Whizlabs courses are good, but lack depth.  Vora's course are detailed but maybe a little tedious, it has a lot of hands-ons that fill the gap left by other courses.  Would I recommend them? Yes, I do, they are well worth the money, which isn't much compared with exam registration fee.

== Practice Exams ==
* [Bonso/TutorialDojo 4 tests](https://www.udemy.com/course/aws-solutions-architect-professional-practice-exams-amazon/) (varies, ~$15, wait for sales)
* [Braincert 7 tests](https://wwww.braincert.com/course/10323-AWS-Certified-Solutions-Architect-%E2%80%93-Professional-Practice-Exams) ($30)
* [Davis 6 tests](https://www.udemy.com/course/aws-certified-solutions-architect-professional-aws-practice-exams/) (varies, ~15)
* [Maarek 1 test](https://www.udemy.com/course/practice-exam-aws-certified-solutions-architect-professional/) (varies, ~15)
* [Whizlabs 6 tests](https://www.whizlabs.com/aws-solutions-architect-professional/) ($15.95)

Doing practice exams is **essential**.  All practice exams have typos and errors, but they still help greatly. Just pick one or 2 from above. Do an exam in one 3-hour setting at least a few times.

== My personal approach ==
1. pick a exam date and register for the exam
2. come up with a study plan
3. stick to the plan
4. (optional) do lots of hands-ons during study
